# Morehouse Olivia LED Lamp Hood

I recently bought two [Morehouse Olivia clip-on LED task
lights](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Newhouse-Lighting-Olivia-LED-Flexible-22-in-Black-Clamp-Lamp-with-Dimming-and-Color-Adjustable-NHCLP-OL-BK/308862933).
I love them. They're great. The only problem is that the light source is too
close to the aperture of the lamp hood, so there's often light shining in your
eyes.

I made this shade to solve the problem. Friction fit. As a bonus, it makes the
lamp look a bit like a tulip.
